**Date**: 2026-01-20 **Status**: Open **Priority**: Low **Parent**:
[Milestone 2: OCP SDK Implementation](../../../2025/12/2025.12.17-milestone-2-ocp-sdk-implementation.md)

## Overview

Implement SDK support for remaining OCF types that are less commonly used in typical cap table
workflows. These should be implemented after higher-priority types are complete.

## Types to Implement (9 types)

### Retraction Types (4 types)

| Type                         | Description                    | DAML Support |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------ |
| ConvertibleRetraction        | Retract a convertible issuance | ✅           |

| WarrantRetraction            | Retract a warrant issuance     | ✅           |

### Equity Compensation Events (2 types)

| Type                        | Description                        | DAML Support |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------ |

| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------ |

## Implementation Notes

### Retraction Types

Retractions are the opposite of issuances - they undo a security that was issued in error:

- `security_id` - The security being retracted
- `reason_text` - Why the retraction is happening

### EquityCompensationRelease

Used when vested options are released (exercised without immediate sale):

- `security_id` - The equity compensation being released
- `resulting_security_ids` - The stock issued as a result

### EquityCompensationRepricing

Used to reprice underwater options:

- `security_id` - The options being repriced
- `resulting_security_ids` - New options with updated strike price

### Stakeholder Events

Used to track changes to stakeholder status/relationships:

- `stakeholder_id` - The stakeholder being updated
- Changes could include: employee → former employee, board member status, etc.

## Validation

```bash
npm run fix                    # Lint/format
npm run typecheck              # Type check
npm test                       # Unit tests
npm run test:integration       # Integration tests
```

## Dependencies

- Batch API must be complete ([Batch Cap Table Updates](./2026.01.12-batch-cap-table-updates.md))
- Higher priority OCF types should be completed first
